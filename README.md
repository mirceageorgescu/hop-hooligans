## Running the project

- Clone the repo
- `npm install`
- `gulp dev` to start the server. It will open the web page for you and do live reload and other fancy stuff.
- `gulp` to create the build.

## Browsersync

After starting the server you can access browsersync's console. It has some nice tools like remote debugging and other geeky stuff. Check it out here:

[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Build

Use the `gulp --minify` flag to generate the static website with minified css, js, svg and imageoptim.

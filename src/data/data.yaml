        - You probably felt the undercurrent.
        - The timid, squeamish whisper of something new, slowly but surely coming your way. It will not bring you false promises, like short-term bursts of delight and brief moments of pause from you daily toils. It will creep into your brain, hijack your senses, turn you into an addict and ultimately ruin you.
        - In time, it will roar and thunder, and the cold, lifeless broadcast of the daily routine will be forever silenced. Not the usual type of cheap manipulation, but rather something that earns your appreciation.
        - The best kind of Crowd Control.
        - Achieve hop bliss.

        - Forget global warming, CO2 emissions, deforestations, fracking, or other atrocities that humans bring upon the environment!
        - 'It seems there’s an even more despicable action that’s directly targeting bears, of all animals: hundreds of bearded, burly brewers invading forests and picking them clean of all their precious berries!'
        - Because what’s more important than a bit of forest berry fragrance in a creamy milk stout, right?
        - But not for long! No longer will bears be just fat and lazy, eating grass and tree bark.
        - If the next time you take out the trash you find yourself on the receiving end of a claw to the face, rejoice! You have just been visited by the newly evolved Dumpster Bear.
        - And now you know who to thank to.

        - Joe is a pretty regular guy. Wakes up early, works his ass off all day long, and then gets back to bed late in the night.
        - Obviously, he goes through quite a few cups of java to maintain this fancy lifestyle.
        - You’d think nothing could surprise him anymore, after all the overpriced mocha frappuccinos, hazelnut ristrettos, gingerbread lattes and exotic Kopi Luwak cold brews.
        - But we got him hooked now! He can’t wrap his head around all the subtle almond, marzipan, cinnamon and vanilla hints in our coffee stout.
        - All of that from a simple bean? This feeling of anxiety and burning thirst for another bottle?
        - That’s just Tonka Rush, Joe!

        - Lately, there’s been talk of a rather peculiar affair happening at the palace.
        - Each day, His Royal Highness dresses up in the fanciest robes and runs straight to the huge treasure room, where he locks himself up for almost half the day.
        - He always comes out to resume his official business with a huge smile on his face. So whatever artefact is in there, certainly must be precious.
        - 'One morning, the treasury is rocked by a terrible event: robbery!'
        - From that day on, the king falls into a hopeless apathy. He can’t even describe his most beloved idol to his loyal subjects, in order for it to be recovered.
        - And, on top of that, the Royal Brewmaster seems to have disappeared from Court.
        - Sad times for the Emperor...

        - Coconuts are weird. And not just because they look like huge mammoth balls.
        - In some countries like the Philippines, the coconut tree is called "tree of life", because its fruit can be used for a huge variety of things. But in some other tropical spots, it's pretty much a serial killer. Death by coconut, they call it.
        - Nevertheless, be careful with what you hold now in your hands. There's so much coconut jammed into this bottle that it's actually a safety hazard. Don't take your eyes off it or you might end up getting blown away by a fiery volley of Cannon Fire.
        - And you'll love it.

        - Everybody knows of the vicious, terrible, goat-sucking creature that strikes fear into the hearts of every poblano down in Mexico.
        - It might be an ugly midget-bear, it might be a hairless mutt, or even some kind of alien, but no footage was ever clear. And it’s been like this for decades. Maybe it got bored of goats?
        - Or maybe it needs just a bit of an incentive. This is where we come in. Get a good camera, get a live goat, feed it a few bottles of the potion that you now hold in your hands and hope for the best.
        - Who doesn’t like creamy chocolate, strong coffee, fragrant spices and a bit of chilli pepper heat?

        - You might be able to carelessly tuck yourself in and sleep soundly after a long stressful day. But right outside your window the city continues to suffer on its own.
        - Car alarms, music, laughter, sirens, stray dogs, broken glass, drunkards singing, bums fighting it out in the alleys and maybe some people even start redecorating their homes at these late hours.
        - As much as Lady Night tries to dampen all this ruckus with its pitch black shroud, there will always be spikes and flashes here and there.
        - 'But only a few lucky restless souls get to catch a glimpse of the real deal. Way high on top of the old buildings. It all changes into a truly beautiful scene: a glimmering contrast of darkness and bright, shiny colours.'
        - Get a break from the mundane, stay up late, find a spot, sip some of this beer and admire the Night Lights.

        - It’s a well known fact that the British people are not to be joked with, especially when it comes to their precious, warm, bland ales.
        - 'There’s a hidden chapter in their history that has lately resurfaced: For a short period of time, taverns served a tastier bitter ale, the rare English Very Special Bitter. It was brewed in accordance with the king’s secret recipe.'
        - The Court found out in the end that the “Very Special” component was, in fact, a Japanese hop. The forbidden Sorachi Ace. Naturally, his head had to be immediately removed, chop chop!
        - His name was lost throughout history. But we honor and respect such crazyness and we hope it was, at least, a Royal Execution.

        - We can't really control hops. If they want to be super fruity, well, you can't exactly stop them. And why would you?
        - Some may bring out zesty citrus, some juicy tropical fruit, some overripe orchard fruit, and some cheeky ones tend to bring out all of those at once.
        - It's up to you to name them all. Think of it as a game. A tasty, refreshing game that you don't ever want to end.
        - So grab a huge glass, or a salad bowl, or a fancy vase, fill it up with a few of these, and have a party with our Summer Punch.
        - Oh, and we have it on good authority that it's good for every season.

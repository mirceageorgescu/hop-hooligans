      description:
        - You probably felt the undercurrent.
        - The timid, squeamish whisper of something new, slowly but surely coming your way. It will not bring you false promises, like short-term bursts of delight and brief moments of pause from you daily toils. It will creep into your brain, hijack your senses, turn you into an addict and ultimately ruin you.
        - In time, it will roar and thunder, and the cold, lifeless broadcast of the daily routine will be forever silenced. Not the usual type of cheap manipulation, but rather something that earns your appreciation.
        - The best kind of Crowd Control.
        - Achieve hop bliss.

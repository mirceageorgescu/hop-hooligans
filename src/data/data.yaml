              The grains are mixed with hot water in a process called mashing. During this process the starches found in
              the grains are converted to fermentable sugars. It usually takes around one hour to fully convert all the starches.<br><br>
              The wort is then slowly pumped to the boiling tank while more hot water is sprinkled above the grain bed in a process
              called sparging. When most of the sweet wort has been collected the spent wort is removed and donated to farmers.

              to the required temperature and keeps it constant throughout the process. We also use the hot
              water to rinse the grains in a process called sparging.

            copy: |
              Fermentation is the process where the yeast indulges on sweet sugars, poops alcohol and burps CO2.
              Every day we measure and record fermentation activity. We monitor this process closely to make sure
              the yeast is happy. If the yeast ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.<br><br>

              After fermentation is done we harvest the yeast and usually add more hops. Adding hops post fermentation
              is called dry-hopping. This adds aroma and flavour to the beer without adding more bitterness.

            copy: |
              Temperature is a crucial factor of the fermentation process. The yeast will produce different flavours
              based on temperature. The warmer it gets, the more esters are produced. You get too hot and you
              start to get solvent-like flavours. Too cold and you could get a sluggish or incomplete fermentation.
              And each yeast strain behaves differently.<br><br>
              Every fermentation vessel is conected to the panel and the temperature is constantly adjusted to
              match the requirements of each phase of the fermentation process.

        - Springtime. A special season of transition, of motion and emotion, passing from a monochromatic snow-laden picture to one that is fresh and vibrant.
        - It’s only natural to feel enticed by these new landscapes, to frolic and flourish for entire months, carelessly.
        - But for some lonely souls out there the story goes quite differently. Lured in by some otherworldly songs and laughter from far away, by fragrances of red and green, by blinding golden rays that warm their frigid heart, they lose track of time and space.
        - Later they wake up naked and betrayed, aching and burning, with short memories of delight.
        - She laughs.
        - And they keep waiting.
        - That’s the real Heartbreaker.

        - A lot of lifting and crouching puts a lot of stress on those pretty glutes and calves of yours.
        - When chilling on the couch doesn’t do it anymore, you have to upgrade and get some serious hands-on  deep tissue massage. Really get in there!

And big, fluffy snowflakes dancing seductively as they float down on top of everything.
        - Nevermind shovelling every morning for two hours in the freezing cold. Oh, and drunk kids on vacation shouting after midnight is just great for your beauty sleep!
        - And the family getting together! And paying half your salary for a damn tree!
        - Such a swell season! Wow! Magical! At least we got some sweet, gloopy, decadent alcoholic beverages to imbibe on.

        - Do it right! Be a true outdoorsman! Sleep under the open sky, drink tree sap, bathe in ice cold river water, eat small animals and tree bark!

        - And then you see his immense stature, his bushy, roughly brushed moustache, his big, burly arms with tacky prison tattoos that really aren’t just a fashion statement.
        - You’ve definitely heard gruesome, violent stories about him.
        - But don’t be afraid, Pith’s chosen to turn over a new leaf. He pushed aside his fury just to indulge in sweet chocolate bars and fresh, zesty oranges.

It will creep into your brain, hijack your senses, turn you into an addict and ultimately ruin you.
        - In time, it will roar and thunder, and the cold, lifeless broadcast of the daily routine will be forever silenced. Not the usual type of cheap manipulation, but rather something that earns your appreciation.

        - A few years ago a silent competition started between hop growers. No longer were the grassy, citrusy, spicy breeds enough for the fancy beer connoisseurs.
        - The demands were high, but finally sated in 2012 when Mosaic brought juicy tropical notes to the IPA table.
        - Sadly, trends always shift, and classics seem to become overrated in time, quickly discarded for the younger, sexier “hop of the year”.
        - But damn them and their fancy pants, sipping glasses and high horses! We cracked our beloved Mosaic to bits, went deep into its core and brought it back to life, raging with juicy mango, jackfruit and maracuja.
        - We rebuilt it into something that seems like a pretty picture. A work of art, if you will.

        - Brewing a traditional german style hefeweizen is serious business. A thorough process riddled with terms like triple decoction, ferulic acid rest and incredibly exact mash and fermentation temperatures.
        - All of that just to get a perfect balance of banana and clove in the aroma, with just the right amount of German hops.
        - Can’t mess with their means because the Reinheitsgebot police will get you...
        - That’s why we tried to get as much banana character as possible, a quaffable body and even a slightly higher alcohol content than usual.

        - Shockingly, after just a few pints, they started shouting nonsense and punching each other senseless. And still drinking beer at the same time!
        - Hard to figure out why that happened, but it might be because of the New Zealand hops. That’s pretty much their national sport, right?!

        - We can't really control hops. If they want to be super fruity, well, you can't exactly stop them. And why would you?
        - Some may bring out zesty citrus, some juicy tropical fruit, some overripe orchard fruit, and some cheeky ones tend to bring out all of those at once.
        - It's up to you to name them all. Think of it as a game. A tasty, refreshing game that you don't ever want to end.
        - So grab a huge glass, or a salad bowl, or a fancy vase, fill it up with a few of these, and have a party with our Summer Punch.
        - Oh, and we have it on good authority that it's good for every season.

        - When local craft beer drinking hole Beer O'Clock decided to make something special for their six year anniversary, a tiny lightbulb lit up. Isn't it about time (bad pun intended!) for the first Romanian craft brewing collaboration?!
        - New guys in town, Hop Hooligans, met up with the mad people at Ground Zero and teamed up.
        - After much kicking, punching, swearing, screaming and breaking bottles, a juicy, tropical, overgenerously hopped IPA was born. A lot of sweat, blood and tears were spilled that day, some might've gotten in the beer, too.
        - There was also a lot of passion involved here, but hey, a gentleman never tells!
      ingredients:

        - Malt (Maris Otter, Wheat, Rye, Caraaroma)

        - You probably felt the undercurrent.
        - The timid, squeamish whisper of something new, slowly but surely coming your way. It will not bring you false promises, like short-term bursts of delight and brief moments of pause from you daily toils. It will creep into your brain, hijack your senses, turn you into an addict and ultimately ruin you.
        - In time, it will roar and thunder, and the cold, lifeless broadcast of the daily routine will be forever silenced. Not the usual type of cheap manipulation, but rather something that earns your appreciation.
        - The best kind of Crowd Control.
        - Achieve hop bliss.

        - 'WTF?! Another IPA?!'
        - 'Of course! Some people don’t know what’s good for them! So we will take it upon ourselves to educate. By force. We’ll strap you down to your bar stool, glue your eyelids open, accessorize you with a nice “harmless” metal hat and force feed you our own brand of medicine: hops!'
        - Nevermind those zapping wires in the background... You’ll forget about them soon enough. If one form of treatment doesn’t work, there’s still time, we have a lot more lined up for you, it’s quite a busy schedule.
        - If it’s not stated on the bottle, ask the closest nurse from this respectable medical institution about the exact version of the medicine.
        - We keep changing the recipe. Just to make sure you get the best out of our

        - Coconuts are weird. And not just because they look like huge mammoth balls.
        - In some countries like the Philippines, the coconut tree is called "tree of life", because its fruit can be used for a huge variety of things. But in some other tropical spots, it's pretty much a serial killer. Death by coconut, they call it.
        - Nevertheless, be careful with what you hold now in your hands. There's so much coconut jammed into this bottle that it's actually a safety hazard. Don't take your eyes off it or you might end up getting blown away by a fiery volley of Cannon Fire.
        - And you'll love it.

        - Everybody knows of the vicious, terrible, goat-sucking creature that strikes fear into the hearts of every poblano down in Mexico.
        - It might be an ugly midget-bear, it might be a hairless mutt, or even some kind of alien, but no footage was ever clear. And it’s been like this for decades. Maybe it got bored of goats?
        - Or maybe it needs just a bit of an incentive. This is where we come in. Get a good camera, get a live goat, feed it a few bottles of the potion that you now hold in your hands and hope for the best.
        - Who doesn’t like creamy chocolate, strong coffee, fragrant spices and a bit of chilli pepper heat?
        - We know you do, but beware, so does the Chupacabra!

        - You might be able to carelessly tuck yourself in and sleep soundly after a long stressful day. But right outside your window the city continues to suffer on its own.
        - Car alarms, music, laughter, sirens, stray dogs, broken glass, drunkards singing, bums fighting it out in the alleys and maybe some people even start redecorating their homes at these late hours.
        - As much as Lady Night tries to dampen all this ruckus with its pitch black shroud, there will always be spikes and flashes here and there.
        - 'But only a few lucky restless souls get to catch a glimpse of the real deal. Way high on top of the old buildings. It all changes into a truly beautiful scene: a glimmering contrast of darkness and bright, shiny colours.'
        - Get a break from the mundane, stay up late, find a spot, sip some of this beer and admire the Night Lights.

        - It’s a well known fact that the British people are not to be joked with, especially when it comes to their precious, warm, bland ales.
        - 'There’s a hidden chapter in their history that has lately resurfaced: For a short period of time, taverns served a tastier bitter ale, the rare English Very Special Bitter. It was brewed in accordance with the king’s secret recipe.'
        - The Court found out in the end that the “Very Special” component was, in fact, a Japanese hop. The forbidden Sorachi Ace. Naturally, his head had to be immediately removed, chop chop!
        - His name was lost throughout history. But we honor and respect such crazyness and we hope it was, at least, a Royal Execution.

        - We can't really control hops. If they want to be super fruity, well, you can't exactly stop them. And why would you?
        - Some may bring out zesty citrus, some juicy tropical fruit, some overripe orchard fruit, and some cheeky ones tend to bring out all of those at once.
        - It's up to you to name them all. Think of it as a game. A tasty, refreshing game that you don't ever want to end.
        - So grab a huge glass, or a salad bowl, or a fancy vase, fill it up with a few of these, and have a party with our Summer Punch.
        - Oh, and we have it on good authority that it's good for every season.
